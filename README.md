# **Usage**
After answering a series of prompts to determine criteria, the website will then generate a secure password that is up to the determined specifications. 
# **Technologies Used**
In this project, only the Javascript was manipulated. 
# **Problems Faced**
It was difficult for me to work though the for loops to get them to accurately pull the information needed and sting it together. Another problem faced was that the password wasn't generating an answer longer than four characters long, which I narrowed down to the .length attribute in my for loop. I added "for (var i=0; i < options.confirmLength; i++) {
    result.push(randomFunction(possibleChar));" and it fixed the issue with the short arrays and a random selection issue. 
# **Credits**
This website was created by me, but could only have been done with the help of my instructor, TAâ€™s, my tutor, and classmates. In that way, it was a collaborative effort.
